# Data Dictionary — Track 1 (The General Manager's Co-Pilot)

Three small, clean CSV files. There are no missing values, no joins to figure out, and no
traps — every number can be taken at face value. The data is deliberately not the challenge.

"Today" in the dataset is **2026-04-01**; the files cover the 90 days before it. The factory
is closed on Sundays. Garments move through four stages:
**KNITTING → ASSEMBLY → WASHING → PACKING**.

| File | Rows | One row is |
|---|---|---|
| `orders.csv` | 120 | One customer order |
| `production_log.csv` | 360 | One stage on one day |
| `workshops.csv` | 8 | One outside workshop's profile card |

## `orders.csv`

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `order_id` | `ORD-001` … |
| `customer`, `product` | Who ordered it and what it is |
| `category` | `TOPS` (sweaters, hoodies, …) or `ACCESSORIES` (beanies, scarves) |
| `pieces` | How many garments |
| `order_date`, `due_date` | When it was placed and when it is due |
| `status` | `COMPLETE` or `IN_PROGRESS` |
| `current_stage` | `KNITTING` / `ASSEMBLY` / `WASHING` / `PACKING` / `COMPLETE` |
| `last_activity_date` | The last day any work was recorded on this order |
| `completed_date` | When it finished (blank if still in progress) |
| `days_late` | `completed_date − due_date`; negative means early; blank if in progress |

## `production_log.csv`

Factory-wide daily output — the table behind *"how much did assembly get through yesterday,
and is that normal?"*

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `date` | The day |
| `stage` | One of the four stages |
| `pieces_completed` | Garments finished at that stage that day (0 on Sundays) |

## `workshops.csv`

The eight outside workshops the factory can rent capacity from when it is full. For
Track 1 this is the table behind feasibility questions — *"can we take 800 hoodies by the
25th?"* needs to know what capacity exists beyond the factory's own.

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `workshop_id`, `name` | `W1` … `W8` and a memorable name |
| `capacity_pieces_per_day` | How much it can process per day; work beyond this queues |
| `pickup_lead_days` | Fixed transport overhead per batch |
| `defect_rate` | Chance a batch comes back defective and is partly redone |
| `cost_per_piece` | What it charges |
| `makes` | `TOPS`, `ACCESSORIES`, or `TOPS+ACCESSORIES` — what it is equipped for |
| `status` | `ACTIVE`, or `SUSPENDED` (failed a quality audit — may not take new work) |
| `max_batch_pieces` | Per-batch cap (workshops on trial); blank means no cap |
| `current_queue_days` | Days of work it is already holding "today" |
| `notes` | The one-line reputation a human dispatcher would give it |
